Hi!

<br><br>

I am Hyper Linker, cybername of Danilo D'Antonio.

<br><br>

I was born <a class="simple" href="http://www.hyperlinker.com/tec/years.htm">16</a> years before the landing on the Moon and the birth of Internet. My first contact with a computer was with a <a class="simple"href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8">PDP8e</a> DEC. Besides having a passion for the shunt of the snail mail, sometimes it loved to <a class="simple" href="pdp8rm.wav">sound</a>. I dived in the cyberspace only <a class="simple" href="http://www.hyperlinker.com/eulab/eulab.txt">27 years</a> after its appearance but since then I never <a class="simple" href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=it&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=%22danilo+d%27antonio%22&btnG=Cerca&meta=">went out</a> of it. This is one of my last <a class="simple" href="service/flying_hl/index.htm">sloops</a>. Besides to computers and Internet, my thoughts has always gone to our Planet. It's not a case that one of my main works is <a class="simple" href="tec/index.htm">The Earth Calendar</a>.

<br><br>

I loved nature and I made all that I was able in order to safeguard it. I have also dedicated to nature a feeled <a class="simple" href="cnt/index.htm">celebration</a>. I would have lived well together with my human brothers, even knowing that an <a class="simple" href="spg/index.htm">excessive</a> number of persons, in absence of a fully accomplished democracy, could make other but to reciprocally ruine and at last take their lives. For this reason I have promoted the spread of an awareness equally <a class="simple" href="ars/en/index.htm">democratic</a> and <a class="simple" href="spg/index.htm">demographic</a> and I have worked hard on a special strategy of peace: the (personal and international) <a class="simple" href="change/agreements.htm">self-containment agreements</a>. Without their stipulation, mankind have no hope to go out safe from the present situation.

<br><br>

Time ago, I have gathered some <a class="simple" href="change/paperi_e_draghi.htm">guide lines</a> for a correct environmental intervention by introducing the concept of <a class="simple" href="change/ecosciopero_0.htm">eco-strike</a> and the <a class="simple" href="change/boscimani.htm">Boscimani Protocol</a>.

I engaged myself in order to re-found our societies on basis of correctness, for example promoting the redistribution with <a class="simple" href="ars/en/index.htm">temporary mandate</a> of the rôles of the public employment in a way that could be guaranteed a <a class="simple" href="ars/lmg.htm">minimum job</a> for every member of the society and to carry out an <a href="ars/index.htm">harmonic social rotation</a>. And I have continuously searched for evolute tools that could help a reciprocal comprehension, like this <a class="simple" href="patchwork/index.htm">proposition, confrontation and deliberation</a> desktop or that could favor the social evolution, like the <a class="simple" href="mercato/index_en.htm">permanent and awarded people's assembly</a>. And I have greatlyenjoyed the discovery of <a class="simple" href="ars/principi.htm">two principles</a> at the base of democracy and of a <a class="simple" href="ars/en/democracy_indicator.htm">single indicator</a> able to determine whith precision its quality e quantity.

<br><br>

Overall, from an approach to social problems limited to the only analysis it was necessary to switch to a more conclusive intervention of <a class="simple" href="change/sociosintesi.htm">sociosynthesis</a>. While another urgency has always been that, at the traditional common politics of the rights, was added a <a class="simple" href="change/doveri.htm">personal culture of the duties</a>. Without forgetting that we we should have involved in the <a class="simple" href="change/fanciullo.htm">protection of the Child</a> from superstitious plagiarism and maybe dedicate a bit ourselves also to the <a class="simple" href="change/child-sharing.htm">child-sharing</a>.

<br><br>

I gave the name <a class="simple" href="eulab/index.htm">Eudaemony Laboratory</a> to my work space and I would have liked to sell my products (if a <a class="simple" href="mercato/index.htm">market for the ideas</a> were opened) in a shop named <a class="simple" href="bottega/index.htm">Alla Buona Sorte</a>. To whom asked me for it, I have indicatet the <a class="simple" href="path/index.htm">way</a> that leads to the power to make clear the things.

<br><br>

Physically I have lived on the <a class="simple" href="abruzzo/alte_terre/index.htm">highlands</a> of Abruzzo, in Italy, where gladly I wandered like an <a class="simple" href="abruzzes.htm">aborigine</a> searching for <a class="simple" href="cibo.htm">food</a> and <a class="simple" href="veritas.htm">truth</a>, but almost my whole intellectual life has flowed in the cyberspace. In order to easily give a date to my friends around the world, I have conceived the idea of an <a class="simple" href="http://www.hyperlinker.com/tec/i_m/index.htm">Internet meridian</a>. As soon as I can I rejoin everywhere my favorite companions of life: artisans, farmers and <a class="simple" href="service/nomad/insieme.htm">sem</a> <a class="simple" href="service/nomad/index.htm">terra</a>.

<br><br>

All nevertheless, I dedicate my work to every excluded/rejected from society. While repudiating all forms of wickedness and illegality, I note that never criminals recognized as such will be able to accomplish what the "<a class="simple" href="ars/genesi_della_mafia.htm">go</a><a class="simple" href="ars/mafia_pubblica.htm">od</a> <a class="simple" href="ars/complotto.htm">peo</a><a class="simple" href="spg/idiots_savants.htm">ple</a>" are capable. And worse for everyone. If only because there is no more time to build, in the chaos in which we maintained ourserves, a peaceful transition from human to artificial epoch, from our species to that we ourselves have created.
